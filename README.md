## Project Overview
The Disease Detection Basing from Symptoms Selection project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict possible diseases based on user-selected symptoms. The goal is to assist users in identifying potential health conditions by leveraging machine learning models trained on medical datasets.

### Key Features
✅ Symptom-Based Diagnosis – Users input symptoms, and the system predicts potential diseases.<br />
✅ Machine Learning Model – Utilizes classification algorithms like Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.<br />
✅ Feature Correlation Analysis – Evaluates the relationship between symptoms to improve prediction accuracy.<br />
✅ Model Performance Evaluation – Includes accuracy scoring, confusion matrices, and classification reports.<br />
✅ User-Friendly Interface – (If applicable) Can be integrated with a UI for easy symptom selection.<br />

### Technologies Used
🟢 Python – Core programming language for data processing and model training.<br />
🟢 Pandas & NumPy – Data handling and manipulation.<br />
🟢 Scikit-Learn – Machine learning model training and evaluation.<br />
🟢 Seaborn & Matplotlib – Data visualization for feature correlation.<br />
🟢 Streamlit/PyCharm – (If applicable) Used for UI development and debugging.<br />

### How It Works
1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing – Medical datasets are loaded, cleaned, and prepared for training.<br />
2️⃣ Model Training – Machine learning classifiers are trained using labeled symptom-disease datasets.<br />
3️⃣ Feature Analysis – Correlations between symptoms and diseases are examined.<br />
4️⃣ Prediction System – Users select symptoms, and the trained model predicts the most probable disease.<br />
5️⃣ Evaluation & Optimization – The system's accuracy is measured and fine-tuned.<br />

### Potential Applications
📌 Healthcare Assistance – Helps users identify potential diseases before consulting a doctor.<br />
📌 Medical Research – Analyzes symptom patterns for disease prediction improvements.<br />
📌 AI-Powered Diagnosis Tools – Can be integrated into telemedicine or health advisory apps.<br />
