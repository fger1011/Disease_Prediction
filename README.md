## Project Overview
The Disease Detection Basing from Symptoms Selection project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict possible diseases based on user-selected symptoms. The goal is to assist users in identifying potential health conditions by leveraging machine learning models trained on medical datasets.

### Key Features
‚úÖ Symptom-Based Diagnosis ‚Äì Users input symptoms, and the system predicts potential diseases.<br />
‚úÖ Machine Learning Model ‚Äì Utilizes classification algorithms like Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
‚úÖ Feature Correlation Analysis ‚Äì Evaluates the relationship between symptoms to improve prediction accuracy.
‚úÖ Model Performance Evaluation ‚Äì Includes accuracy scoring, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
‚úÖ User-Friendly Interface ‚Äì (If applicable) Can be integrated with a UI for easy symptom selection.

### Technologies Used
üü¢ Python ‚Äì Core programming language for data processing and model training.
üü¢ Pandas & NumPy ‚Äì Data handling and manipulation.
üü¢ Scikit-Learn ‚Äì Machine learning model training and evaluation.
üü¢ Seaborn & Matplotlib ‚Äì Data visualization for feature correlation.
üü¢ Streamlit/PyCharm ‚Äì (If applicable) Used for UI development and debugging.

### How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preprocessing ‚Äì Medical datasets are loaded, cleaned, and prepared for training.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training ‚Äì Machine learning classifiers are trained using labeled symptom-disease datasets.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Analysis ‚Äì Correlations between symptoms and diseases are examined.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction System ‚Äì Users select symptoms, and the trained model predicts the most probable disease.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation & Optimization ‚Äì The system's accuracy is measured and fine-tuned.

### Potential Applications
üìå Healthcare Assistance ‚Äì Helps users identify potential diseases before consulting a doctor.
üìå Medical Research ‚Äì Analyzes symptom patterns for disease prediction improvements.
üìå AI-Powered Diagnosis Tools ‚Äì Can be integrated into telemedicine or health advisory apps.
